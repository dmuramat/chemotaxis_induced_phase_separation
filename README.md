# Chemotaxis-induced phase separation

In this repository, the code for the project *Chemotaxis-induced phase separation* 
by Henrik Weyer, David Muramatsu, and Erwin Frey is included. 

The code for the simulations and analysis for Fig. 2. is included in the COMSOL (`.mph`) files, 
and the iPython notebooks `chymograph_log_time_rho0.03.ipynb`, `chymograph_log_time_rho0.03.ipynb` (Fig.2 (c)),
and `coarsening_analysis.ipynb` (Fig. 2 (d)).
